= Instructions:

In this lab we will find the customers who were active in consecutive months of May and June. Follow the steps to complete the analysis.

== Create a table rentals_may

to store the data from rental table with information for the month of May

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
CREATE TABLE rentals_may AS
SELECT
    *
FROM
    rental
LIMIT
    0;
```

to verify the table:

```sql
DESCRIBE rental;
```

== Insert values in the table rentals_may

using the table rental, filtering values only for the month of May

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
INSERT INTO rentals_may
SELECT
    *
FROM
    rental
WHERE
    monthname(rental_date) = 'May';
```

_to verify that the data was inserted into the table:_


```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    rentals_may
LIMIT
    3;
```

TIP: _the last two questions can be done in only one query as follow:_

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
CREATE TABLE rentals_may AS
SELECT
    *
FROM
    rental
WHERE
    monthname(rental_date) = 'May';
```

_To verify that the table was created along with the data:_

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    rentals_may
LIMIT
    5;
```

== Create a table rentals_june

to store the data from rental table with information for the month of June

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
CREATE TABLE rentals_june AS
SELECT
    *
FROM
    rental
WHERE
    monthname(rental_date) = 'June';

`*_Answer:_*`

_Already done in the previous question_



== Check the number of rentals for each customer for May

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    concat((b.last_name), ' ', (b.first_name)) AS customer_name,
    count(*) AS number_of_films_rented_may
FROM
    rentals_may a
